## What's New

**FreeCCR 1.2.2** — a macOS color-accuracy fix.

- **Previews now match exports on wide-gamut Macs.** On Display P3 screens, the app preview rendered more saturated than the exported TIFF/JPEG — the export was always correct (ICC-tagged and color-managed), but Qt's preview window wasn't color-matched to the display. Every window is now tagged sRGB so macOS color-matches the whole app to the display profile, and preview colors match what you export.

## Install

### Windows
Download the installer (`FreeCCR_Install_*.exe`) from the **Assets** below and run it.

### macOS (Apple Silicon)
Download `FreeCCR_macOS_*.zip` from the **Assets**, unzip it, and move `FreeCCR.app` into your **Applications** folder.

⚠️ **macOS may say the app is "damaged and can't be opened" — it isn't.** FreeCCR isn't notarized by Apple, so Gatekeeper blocks unsigned downloads on first launch. Clear the quarantine flag once by running this in **Terminal**:

```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/FreeCCR.app
```

Then open the app normally.

*Alternative:* right-click the app → **Open** → **Open**. On macOS Sequoia (15), if no "Open" button appears, use the Terminal command above, or go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**.

### Linux (x86_64)
**AppImage (recommended):** download `FreeCCR_Linux_*-x86_64.AppImage` from the **Assets**, make it executable, and run it:

```
chmod +x FreeCCR_Linux_*-x86_64.AppImage
./FreeCCR_Linux_*-x86_64.AppImage
```

**Portable folder:** download `FreeCCR_Linux_*-x86_64.tar.gz`, extract it anywhere, and run `FreeCCR/FreeCCR`. Fully self-contained — no Python or packages to install.

Built on Ubuntu 22.04, so it runs on any x86_64 distro with glibc 2.35 or newer: Ubuntu 22.04+, Linux Mint 21+, Debian 12+, Fedora 36+, openSUSE, Arch, etc.
