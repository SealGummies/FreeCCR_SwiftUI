## What's New

**FreeCCR 1.2.1** — an Auto Gain retune and an onboarding fix.

- **Auto Gain leaves headroom.** Converted frames now place the top 2 % of in-bound highlights at 95 % of the visible window (previously the top 0.1 % was pushed to 99.8 %, parking highlights against display white). Frames whose highlights already sat at the top get a slight pull down to the new target.
- **The startup hint teaches the B/W-point workflow.** The hint shown for a fresh negative used to recommend drawing a reference frame (the legacy path). It now walks through **Set Black Point** → **Convert Current** (with **Set White Point** as the optional two-point refinement), and it no longer keeps re-appearing on images that are already converted.

## Install

### Windows
Download the installer (`FreeCCR_Install_*.exe`) from the **Assets** below and run it.

### macOS (Apple Silicon)
Download `FreeCCR_macOS_*.zip` from the **Assets**, unzip it, and move `FreeCCR.app` into your **Applications** folder.

⚠️ **macOS may say the app is "damaged and can't be opened" — it isn't.** FreeCCR isn't notarized by Apple, so Gatekeeper blocks unsigned downloads on first launch. Clear the quarantine flag once by running this in **Terminal**:

```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/FreeCCR.app
```

Then open the app normally.

*Alternative:* right-click the app → **Open** → **Open**. On macOS Sequoia (15), if no "Open" button appears, use the Terminal command above, or go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**.

### Linux (x86_64)
**AppImage (recommended):** download `FreeCCR_Linux_*-x86_64.AppImage` from the **Assets**, make it executable, and run it:

```
chmod +x FreeCCR_Linux_*-x86_64.AppImage
./FreeCCR_Linux_*-x86_64.AppImage
```

**Portable folder:** download `FreeCCR_Linux_*-x86_64.tar.gz`, extract it anywhere, and run `FreeCCR/FreeCCR`. Fully self-contained — no Python or packages to install.

Built on Ubuntu 22.04, so it runs on any x86_64 distro with glibc 2.35 or newer: Ubuntu 22.04+, Linux Mint 21+, Debian 12+, Fedora 36+, openSUSE, Arch, etc.
