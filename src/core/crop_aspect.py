Pure (Qt-free) geometry + presets backing the Crop panel's aspect-ratio and
straighten features. Kept import-light and side-effect-free so it can be unit
tested without a GUI. See spec/crop-panel.md.

Ratios are width/height in *Landscape* orientation; `oriented_ratio` applies the
portrait/landscape toggle, and `effective_box_ratio` maps an on-screen target
ratio onto the un-rotated image space the crop box lives in (90/270 coarse
rotation swaps width<->height).
